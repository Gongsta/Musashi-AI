# Musashi-AI


Pipeline
1. Preprocess the image to generate crops for each ROI
2. Create a small validation set to evaluate performance


Model:
- Most of the regions seem not to have any person, however there are potentially other people in the region.

Internal Evaluations:
- We hand-labeled about 100 images which we used as our validation set
